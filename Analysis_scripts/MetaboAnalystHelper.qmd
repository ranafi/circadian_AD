### Read in translation dict for metaboanalyst

```{r}
trans_dict = readxl::read_xlsx("../metabolic_data/metaboanalyst_trans.xlsx")
#The reason this file is needed is that metaboanalyst does not recognize all of the compound names provided by metabolon. This file was generated in the following way: I took metabolon_data_key HMDB ID's and converted them to compound IDs with MetaboAnalyst. But not all of the compoounds had HMDB IDs. Of these, I converted the pubChem IDs given in the metabolon_data_key to compound names in metaboAnalyst. 
```

### Read metabolite list:

```{r}
cycling_in_CTL = read_csv("../Cyclops_ordering/metabolon/cycling_in_CTL.csv", show_col_types = F)
cycling_in_CTL_BHQ1  = filter(cycling_in_CTL, BHQ < 0.1)

cycling_in_AD = read_csv("../Cyclops_ordering/metabolon/cycling_in_AD.csv",show_col_types = F)
cycling_in_AD_BHQ1 = filter(cycling_in_AD, BHQ < 0.1)

diff_cycling = read_csv("../Cyclops_ordering/metabolon/diff_rhythms_CyclingBHQ1.csv", show_col_types = F)
diff_cycling_BHQ = filter(diff_cycling, p_val < 0.05)

gain_amp = read_csv("../Cyclops_ordering/metabolon/diff_rhythms_CyclingBHQ1.csv", show_col_types = F) %>% dplyr::filter( p_val < 0.05 & Log_AD_CTL_ampRatio > 0 )

lose_amp = read_csv("../Cyclops_ordering/metabolon/diff_rhythms_CyclingBHQ1.csv", show_col_types = F) %>% dplyr::filter( p_val < 0.05 & Log_AD_CTL_ampRatio < 0 )
```

### Merge with trans_dict

```{r}
cycling_CTL = merge(cycling_in_CTL_BHQ1, trans_dict, by.x = "SHORT_NAME", by.y = "SHORT_NAME_Metabolon", suffixes = "_metaboAnalyst")

cycling_AD = merge(cycling_in_AD_BHQ1, trans_dict, by.x = "SHORT_NAME", by.y = "SHORT_NAME_Metabolon", suffixes = "_metaboAnalyst")

diff_cycling_out = merge(diff_cycling_BHQ, trans_dict, by.x = "SHORT_NAME", by.y = "SHORT_NAME_Metabolon", suffixes = "_metaboAnalyst")

gain_amp_out = merge(gain_amp, trans_dict, by = "SHORT_NAME", by.y = "SHORT_NAME_Metabolon", suffixes = "_metaboAnalyst")

lose_amp_out = merge(lose_amp, trans_dict, by = "SHORT_NAME", by.y = "SHORT_NAME_Metabolon", suffixes = "_metaboAnalyst")

write.table(cycling_CTL, "../Cyclops_ordering/metabolon/MetaboAnalyst/Cycling_in_CTL_BHQ1.csv", sep = ',', row.names = F)
write.table(cycling_AD, "../Cyclops_ordering/metabolon/MetaboAnalyst/Cycling_in_AD_BHQ1.csv", sep = ',', row.names = F)
